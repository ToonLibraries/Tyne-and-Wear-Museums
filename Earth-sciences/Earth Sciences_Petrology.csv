Sometimes, they are long and thin, and can look like bones or teeth. They are often mistaken for parts of skeletons. Flint fossils are quite common, but not in the north east of England, as the rocks here are older than the Chalk in which flint is found. Common flint fossils include sea urchins and sponges. Sometimes these flit nodules can be found on the beaches in the North East. This is because they were brought here in ships which used rocks from the South as ballast (in order to keep the ship sitting correctly in the water). These rocks were then later dumped when the ship took on its true cargo (usually coal).|||||Cretaceous (Late) / 65 - 98 my|Chalk Formation||||||||||||||1

It is approximately 250 million years old, but, unfortunately, no one knows exactly how it formed.

Collected by M.S. Humphrey, June 2004.|This black limestone pebble contains the fossilised remains of crinoids (sea lilies) and brachiopods (lampshells). These are the white markings on the surface of the pebble. This pebble has become smooth as it has rolled among other pebbles on the beach, by the action of the sea. The fossils in the pebble have been worn away, so their shapes can be misleading. Sometimes the crinoids can look like 'the mint with the hole', or rows of teeth. Fossilised shells sometimes look like figure '6's or '9's. The part seen at the surface of the rock depends on what angle you are looking at the fossil.|||||Carboniferous / 290 - 362 my||Humphrey, Ms Mary Sylvia - Great North Museum: Hancock|2004-06-|UK, England, Northumberland (NE England), Longhoughton (foreshore)|||||||||||2

Collected from the Glaramara Tuff, Seathwaite Fell Formation, Borrowdale Volcanic Group of Ordovician, Middle Caradoc age from Kentmere Quarry, Kentmere, Cumbria (NW England). Collected by Eric Johnson, 1999.|The small circular shapes on the surface of this piece of rock were made by hailstones that formed during a volcanic eruption, approximately 450 million years ago. We can see where the hailstones fell on this rock, because they were coated with dust from the volcano. It is this dust that has made the pale round marks. Therefore, in a way, these are fossil hailstones!|Tuff||||Ordovician & Caradoc (Middle) / 449 - 452 my|Glaramara Tuff & Seathwaite Fell Formation|Johnson, Eric|1999|UK, England, Cumbria (NW England), Kentmere|Kentmere Quarry||||||||||1
