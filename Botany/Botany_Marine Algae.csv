188707|NEWHM : AX0084|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Dabberlocks & Wing Kelp|Marine algae|This seaweed is known as Dabberlocks in Scotland and Wing Kelp or Bladder Locks in England. The name Wing Kelp comes from the two rows of leafy reproductive structures, called sporophylls, growing from the stipe (stem) near the holdfast. This seaweed usually grows on rocks that are exposed to sea action and in rock pools at low water. It is the only kelp-like seaweed in Britain and Ireland that has a distinct midrib and has leaflets at the base of the frond. This specimen comes from the foot of the castle at Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear.||Laminariales & Alariaceae & Alaria esculenta (L.) Grev. : : : Phaeophyceae :||1855-04-13|UK, England, Tyne and Wear, Tynemouth (Castle Foot)||||||<SUMMARY-DESCRIPT>: The midrib running through the frond of this seaweed is a characteristic used to identify it as a Wing Kelp. There is a short stipe (stem) between the frond and the claw-like holdfast at the bottom., The leafy sporophylls growing from the stipe are another characteristic used to identify this specimen as a Wing Kelp. The sporophylls contain the reproductive organs. The holdfast is used to hold the seaweed onto a rock.|1
189374|NEWHM : AX0762|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|2|algae|Seaweed & Plocamium|Marine algae|This beautiful seaweed goes by the name of Plocamium cartilagineum because it has no common name. It grows in the intertidal zone nearest the sea as well as in shallow water just below the lowest tide. This specimen comes from Spittal, Northumberland and is from the W.C. Trevelyan collection.||Rhodophyta & Florideophyceae & Gigartinales & Plocamiaceae & Plocamium cartilagineum (L.) Dixon : : : : Rhodophyta||1855-06-|UK, England, Northumberland, Spittal||||||<SUMMARY-DESCRIPT>: The colour and shape of Plocamium cartilagineum makes it a popular choice with collectors. It is easily pressed to display in an attractive way. The most recent name appears on the label attached to the sheet and is crossed out and replaced with newer names over time., It is common practise to keep the original name of a plant on the herbarium sheet. In this case, the old name is Plocamium coccineum. Names sometimes change as more research is done., Plocamium cartilagineum is a good example of a seaweed whose name has changed over time. Historically, it has been confused with several other seaweeds. Some scientists believe that it is still not classified in the right family so there may be more changes to come.|1
189427|NEWHM : AX0816|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Sea Lettuce|Marine algae|Sea lettuce gets this name because its fronds look like lettuce. It is common in the part of the intertidal zone (the area between the lowest and highest tides) that is nearest to the sea. Sea lettuce is usually attached to rocks but can grow into large mats on top of the water in very sheltered areas. This specimen comes from the Berwick upon Tweed area of Northumberland and was once part of the Nathaniel J. Winch collection.||Chlorophyta & Chlorophyceae & Ulvales & Ulvaceae & Ulva lactuca L. : : : : Chlorophyta|||UK, England, Northumberland, Berwick upon Tweed (nr.)|||||||1
189945|NEWHM : AX2699|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|6|algae|Seaweed & Irish Moss|Marine algae|All but the specimen in the top left corner are examples of Chondrus crispus. The other related seaweed is called Gigartina stellata. Both are collected as Carrageen or Irish Moss. Carrageenan is extracted from these algae and used in foods such as ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming. It is also useful for making soups and jellies and is even found in toothpaste. Irish Moss grows in the intertidal zone nearest the sea as well as in shallow water just below the lowest tide. These specimens are from the N.J. Winch collection.||Rhodophyta & Florideophyceae & Gigartinales & Gigartinaceae & Chondrus crispus Stackh. : : : : Rhodophyta|||[irn: 47844]||||||<SUMMARY-DESCRIPT>: This herbarium sheet holds five specimens of Chondrus crispus and one (top left) of Gigartina stellata. The Gigartina stellata looks very similar to the Chondrus crispus but the flattened part (blade) tends to roll inwards to form a channel., Collectors usually try to press the whole plant so that all parts are present. In this case, the stipes (stems) radiate from the holdfast and branch into fronds or blades., This specimen of Chondrus crispus is missing its holdfast. You may find lots of these washed up on the shoreline after a storm.|1
189972|NEWHM : AX2726|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Dulse|Marine algae|"Palmaria palmata, also known as ""Dulse"", gets its scientific name from its similarity to the shape of a human hand. It is common in the intertidal zone, particularly near low water. Sun dried dulse is eaten as is or ground into flakes or powder for use in soups, chowders and other foods. Dulse is low in sodium but high in some vitamins, iron and potassium. This specimen comes from St. Mary's Island, Tyne and Wear & England & UK."||Rhodophyta & Florideophyceae & Palmariales & Palmariaceae & Palmaria palmata (L.) O. Kuntze : : : : Rhodophyta|Davis, P.

190090|NEWHM : AX2846|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Purple Laver|Marine algae|Purple laver is an ingredient in the laver bread that is traditionally prepared for the feast day of the Welsh patron saint, St. David. Laver is also boiled and then eaten as a jelly, or sometimes eaten cold with vinegar. Laver is found in the intertidal zone, often in the areas that are furthest from the sea.

190348|NEWHM : AX3105|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Green Sea Fingers|Marine algae|This seaweed gets the name 'green sea fingers', or 'dead man's fingers', from its shape. It is not native to Britain and probably arrived here attached to shellfish, such as oysters, on the hulls of ships travelling from the Pacific Ocean. Only one cell forms the body of this seaweed. This specimen comes from Ross Sands in Northumberland .||Chlorophyta & Chlorophyceae & Codiales & Codiaceae & Codium fragile (Sur.)

190399|NEWHM : AX3156|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Knotted Wrack|Marine algae|Knotted Wrack gets its name from the shape formed by the single air bladders in each of the long, flattened fronds. This seaweed drapes down over intertidal rocks and has many fronds growing from its base, known as a 'holdfast'. These fronds are replaced when the old ones break off. Knotted Wrack grows slowly and is reported to live for several decades. This specimen comes from St. Mary's Island, Tyne and Wear .||Fucales & Fucaceae & Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol. : : : Phaeophyceae :|Bernard, Miss C. L.|30/10/1988|UK, England, Tyne and Wear, St. Mary's Island||||||<SUMMARY-DESCRIPT>: The reddish-brown tufts of algae growing on this specimen are Polysiphonia lanosa, a species that is often associated with Knotted Wrack. It lives on the Knotted Wrack without harming it so it is considered to be an epiphyte., The single bladders of Knotted Wrack differentiate this seaweed from Bladder Wrack which has paired bladders. The bladders help the plant float closer to the surface when it is under water. Like all seaweeds, it needs light in order to manufacture its food.|1
190564|NEWHM : H6072|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|seaweed & green sea intestines|Marine algae|This seaweed is tubular and takes the shape of intestines. It is aptly called Enteromorpha (meaning 'form') intestinalis (meaning 'of the intestines'), or Green Sea Intestines. This green alga grows in both marine and freshwater environments as it is able to adapt to extremes in salt levels. It is one of the most common seaweeds in Britain.||Chlorophyta & Enteromorpha intestinalis : : : : Chlorophyta|Lacey, Dr A.|||||||||1
190624|NEWHM : H6154|Natural Sciences|Botany|Marine Algae|1|algae|Seaweed & Bladder Wrack|Marine algae|Bladder Wrack gets its name from the air bladders that form either side of the midrib in each frond. The paired bladders differentiate this seaweed from Knotted Wrack which has single bladders. Bladder wrack usually lives in the middle part of the intertidal zone. This specimen comes from Beadnell, Northumberland .||Heterokontophyta & Phaeophyceae & Fucus vesiculosus : : : :|Lacey, Dr A.|1965-11-|UK, England, Northumberland, Beadnell||||||<SUMMARY-DESCRIPT>: The air bladders located on either side of the midrib are characteristic of this Bladder Wrack specimen. The fronds are neither spiralled nor serrated (like a steak knife). The swollen areas at the ends of the fronds contain the reproductive organs., The air bladders in Bladder Wrack usually come in pairs. Air bladders help the seaweed to float towards the surface when the tide is in. The seaweed receives more light which it needs in order to manufacture its food., The holdfast on Bladder Wrack is a small disc. It anchors the seaweed to a rock to keep it from drifting away in the water.|1
