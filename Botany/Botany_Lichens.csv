175641|NEWHM : 2002.H4144.19|Natural Sciences|Botany|Lichens|6|lichen||Lichen|This species is widespread on acid soils in moist, woodland environments throughout Europe, Asia and temperate North America. It prefers slightly acid soils, and will also grow on rocky surfaces in areas which receive lots of rainfall. It belongs to a distinctive group of species that produce bright red reproductive structures.
