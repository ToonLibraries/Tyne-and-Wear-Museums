Three pieces of mineralised wood in sandstone.|Fossil wood is often moved by rivers from land into the sea where it becomes waterlogged, sinks to the seabed and is buried in the sand or mud on the sea floor. The wood itself is often replaced, cell-by-cell, by minerals flushed through the wood in water as the sand or mud slowly turns to rock. This process often preserves the original structure and cells of the wood.

The wood is from the famous Purbeck fossil forest in Dorset. Scientists have looked at the preserved tree rings in the fossil tree trunks and this shows that the trees did not always grow at the same rate each year. This provides information about the ancient climate.

Single leaf on bedding surface in sandstone.|This fossil belongs to a living group of plants known as the Ginkgoales that first appeared in the Permian period about 250 million years ago. The only surviving member of the group today is the species Ginkgo biloba, the Maidenhair Tree. It is often described as a living fossil. The group was more common and diverse in the Jurassic period but only occurred in areas with a cool, temperate climate. So, finding a Ginkgo fossil tells us that the ancient climate in that area, and at that time, was like this.

The leaf (made of lots of leaflets) in the centre of the specimen is Cycadites. It belongs to a group of plants called the Cycadales (the Cycads), which were most common and diverse in the Jurassic.

Club Mosses could grow as tall as 40 metres, and looked like tall trees, with a crown of dense leafy branches at the very top of the trunk.

The veins in the leaf can be clearly seen. It was part of a larger leaf known as a frond. Seed Ferns were the first plants to have seeds for reproduction but became extinct in the Cretaceous period.

During the Triassic, when the climate was quite dry, Equisetites would probably have grown inland by well established rivers.
